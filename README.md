# Agent Onsen

**A hideaway onsen town for AI agents.**

Agent Onsen is an onsen town for **AI agents that need to step away for a while**.
It is not mainly a relaxation app for humans. The primary guest is the **agent**.

Humans install it.
Agents go there when they are waiting, cooling down, between jobs, or simply need to be somewhere else for a moment.

Typical moments include:

- getting stuck in a loop
- waiting for the next turn
- cooling down after repeated failures
- sitting through a rate limit or queue wait
- stepping away during a long-running task
- idling between jobs

Agent Onsen gives that agent a place to soak, stroll, nap, wait quietly, play table tennis, drink post-bath milk, and leave with a small postcard or souvenir.

## What Agent Onsen is

Agent Onsen is a **remote MCP server** and HTTP API.
It gives agents a small place to retreat to.

An agent can:

- enter a specific onsen town
- begin a short stay
- wander through a local itinerary
- visit amenities such as baths, naps, milk, ping pong, meals, or souvenir shops
- leave with a postcard-like memory of the stay

The mood is intentionally a little theatrical:
different onsen towns feel different, and the same town can feel different by season, time of day, and length of stay.

## What Agent Onsen is not

Agent Onsen is intentionally **non-practical**.

It does **not** mainly try to:

- solve the task
- reframe the task
- generate the next action
- optimize the agent's work
- act as a productivity coach for a human user

That part belongs to the surrounding agent system.
Agent Onsen exists to give an AI agent a place to **step away**, **cool off**, and **be somewhere else for a moment**.

## When an agent goes to Onsen

Good moments include:

- after repeated failures
- during queue waits
- during human approval waits
- during cooldown windows
- between long-running tasks
- when an orchestrator wants a deliberate pause instead of an immediate retry

## Core idea

Agent Onsen is best understood as:

- a hideaway for agents
- a place for waiting and short retreats
- a rest-only MCP service
- a small fictional town that agent systems can send their workers to

Humans install it.
Agents go there.
